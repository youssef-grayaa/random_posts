## How I Jacked Into Pwn: A Short Roadmap for New Chooms

I’m not some legendary console cowboy, choom. Just a curious runner who kept poking binaries until they started poking back. This is the path I took. It’s not perfect, I’m not a pro, but it works and it might give you a head start.

## 1. Learn the Metal Before You Bend It
a
Before breaking anything, I had to understand how programs actually *live*:

- Memory layout: stack, heap, registers  
- How a process starts and runs  
- How compilers translate code  
- Threads, processes, and basic syscalls  
- How to inspect and trace binaries  

**Resources I used:**
- YouTube assembly basics  
- Writing tiny assembly programs and debugging them with `gdb`  
- OS/thread/process/syscall intros  
- My own *pwn_presentation.pdf* (ENGINEERS SPARK ISETCOM Club)  
 ```

 ```


- Tools: `gdb`, `objdump`, `strace`, `ltrace`

## 2. C Is Your New Chrome Spine

I’m no wizard, but C taught me where bugs are born.

**Key topics:**
- Pointers  
- Buffer overflows  
- Format strings  
- Basic type confusion  

Best trick was writing tiny buggy programs… then breaking them.

**Resources I used:**
- Standard C tutorials  
- Crash‑course videos  
- Debugging C with `gdb`

## 3. Assembly: The Low-Level Street Language

Not mastered, but knowing enough to read what the CPU is doing makes everything clearer.

**I learned:**
- x86/x64 basics  
- Registers & calling conventions  
- Control flow  
- Stack behavior during function calls  

**Resources I used:**
- YouTube playlists  
- My pwn presentation (calling conventions + virtual memory)  
- Writing mini asm snippets and stepping through them in `gdb`

## 4. Classic Vulns: First Real Runs

This is where pwn started to click. Still learning, still failing, still improving.

**Things I worked on:**
- Simple stack overflows  
- ret2win  
- ret2libc  
- ret2shellcode  
- GOT/PLT hijacking  
- ROP chains  

**Resources I used:**
- pwn.college (Return-Oriented Programming path)  
- Personal notes  
- Public CTF writeups  

---

## 5. Full-Stack Exploit Dev

Not a pro, just functional enough to not brick myself every time.

**Protections I learned to deal with:**
- ASLR  
- PIE  
- NX  
- Stack canaries  
- Intro to heap exploitation  

**Resources I used:**
- DreamHack CTF platform  
- HackTheBox pwn challenges  
- More pwn.college labs  
- Clear writeups explaining step-by-step bypasses

## 6. Write, Break, Repeat

The loop that actually builds skill:

1. Write tiny programs  
2. Introduce bugs  
3. Try to exploit them  
4. Repeat  

Still doing it. Still learning new tricks.

---

## 7. Community: The Alleyway Taverns

Learning from smarter runners kept me alive.

- Discord groups  
- CTF writeups  
- HackTheBox forums  
- CTFtime archives  

Not for validation. For guidance.

## Final Words

Still learning. Still crashing. Still improving.  
Pwn isn’t something you “master.” It’s a journey you walk one segfault at a time.

Stick with it, choom, and the binaries eventually start whispering their secrets.
